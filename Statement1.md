## 📝 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to design and implement a machine learning system that predicts a student’s final academic performance based on their intermediate records, demographic information, and other relevant features.  
Early identification of students who might be at risk of underperforming enables timely intervention and personalized academic support, thus improving learning outcomes.

## 🎯 Scope

This project applies key concepts from the **Fundamentals in AI and ML (CSA2001)** course, focusing on supervised learning techniques such as classification and regression models.  
The system will handle:

- Data preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training  
- Evaluation  
- Prediction generation  

Emphasis is placed on modular code, efficient predictions, and robust handling of real-world data issues.

## 👥 Target Users

- Academic counselors  
- Teachers and educators  
- School/college administrative staff  
- Students who wish to track and improve their performance  

These users can utilize the system to monitor progress and enable proactive support.
